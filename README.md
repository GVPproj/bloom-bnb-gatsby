# Bed and Breakfast Website

Built with Gatsby JS (and React) & Styled Components.  

## Deploy

- gatsby clean
- fresh git commit and push
- npm run deploy

## Todo

### Urgent

- phone number in contact
- prices in index and orchard
"230 per night, 2 nights minimum, 3 nights on long weekends, 75- cleaning fee"
- email buttons

- CSS Refactor (further styled components implementation)
- target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" on various links
- index button same placement as orchard

## Issues

- deployment can require resetting dns on Github Pages (adding CNAME)
